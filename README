Auth-Sticky version 0.86
=======================

Auth::Sticky is an OOP-based, drop-in authentication system for CGI,
mod_perl, or FCGI applications that gets user information from an
SQL database. As the SQL calls are rather simple, any DBD supported
by DBI.pm should work just fine.
Developers are encouraged to submit ideas and/or patches to
shellshark at shellshark dot net.
